# Introduction to Web

# What is Internet?
##### The Internet is the world's largest computer communication network. Millions of smaller home, academic, business, and government networks make up the Internet, which together convey a wide range of information. It originated as a research project at a university in 1969 and grew into a global commercial network in the 1990s. It is now utilized by over 2 billion people all across the world.

### What's an IP address?
##### Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses) are numbers that allow computers to communicate with one another over the internet.

### What is the cloud?
##### The Internetâ€”more particularly, everything you can access remotely over the Internet is the cloud. When you say anything is in the cloud, you're referring to the fact that it's saved on Internet servers rather than on your computer's hard drive.
 
### What is a packet?
##### A packet is the smallest unit of data that can be sent over the internet. The network's capacity can be used more efficiently by breaking information down into small, consumable chunks

### What is the World Wide Web?
##### The World Wide Web (WWW), sometimes known as the Web, is an information system in which documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which can be linked together via hyperlinks, and are accessible through the Internet.  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to transfer Web resources, which can be accessed by users through a web browser and published by a web server. The World Wide Web is not to be confused with the Internet, which predates the Web in some form by more than two decades and is based on the same technologies as the Web.

### What's a web browser?
##### A web browser is software that allows you to access the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a certain website, the web browser requests the material from a web server and displays it on the user's device.
