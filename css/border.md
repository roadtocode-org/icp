# CSS Borders

## You may style, width, and colour the border of an element using CSS border attributes.
### This is a shorthand for the CSS properties listed below:
- border-style
- border-width
- border-color

## border-style
### The border-style attribute determines the type of border that will be displayed.
### Following are the values of border-style:
- ```dotted``` : A dotted border is defined by this property.
- ```dashed``` : A dashed border is defined by this property.
- ```solid```  : A solid border is defined by this property.
- ```double``` : A double border is defined by this property.
- ```groove``` : Defines a three-dimensional grooved border. The outcome is determined on the border-color value.
- ```ridge```  : Defines a three-dimensional ridged border. The outcome is determined on the border-color value.
- ```inset```  : Defines a three-dimensional inset border. The outcome is determined on the border-color value.
- ```outset``` : Defines a three-dimensional outset border. The outcome is determined on the border-color value.
- ```none```   : No border is defined by this property.
- ```hidden``` : Defines hidden border.

## Syntax :
### One to four values can be assigned to the border-style property (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).
